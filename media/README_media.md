Once upon a time, in a digital realm filled with stories on the silver screen, a movie dataset emerged, brimming with rich insights waiting to be discovered. The dataset contained *2,652* entries, encapsulating diverse tales narrated through movies, split across vibrant languages, and spanning various genres. 

**The Language of Cinema**
English emerged as the dominant language, featuring in *1,306* entries, suggesting that English-language movies consult the largest demographic of viewers within this dataset.

The dataset captured a *total of 11 languages*, highlighting the eclectic nature of storytelling.

The analysis showed a primary focus on *movies*, which took the spotlight with *2,211* entries. Among the dates documented in the dataset, the earliest film dated back to *21-May-2006*, revealing a timeline of trends in the film industry.
